360;;Vancouver Morris Men;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=360;"There are 15 members of the troup.
The dances and plays vary with the seasons of the year:
FOR AUTUMN AND WINTER These are the ""dark"" seasons, when, for the Vancouver Morris Men, the Morris takes on a different, more earthy character - some say degenerate! This is when the Vancouver Morris Men perform WELSH BORDER MORRIS. We wear dark clothes and rags and have our faces ""blacked"" as a form of disguise. The Welsh Border dances are probably the oldest variants of the Morris. Nearly all the dances consist of vigourous stepping and powerful stick clashing accompanied by a loud band comprising melodeon, banjo, fiddle, whistle, drums, triangle, trombone and tuba! See some picutres of us dancing Welsh Border here.
On Plough Sunday (the first Sunday after 12th night), we perform MOLLY DANCING and assoicated rituals from East Anglia. (Traditionally, these dances and rituals were performed on the first Monday after 12th night, but as most of us are at work on that day - unlike olden times! - we've moved the event one day earlier.) For Molly dancing, the men, dressed in old farmers clothes and with blackened faces, typically carry a plough from door-to-door, performing a strange, stamping dance lead by the ""head"" couple - the King and the Molly (a ""man-woman""). The photo to the right was taken in 1992 during our inaugural Molly dance-out, an event which has now become a regular, annual event. The dances, which come from the villages of Girton and Comberton near Cambridge, are based on Feast Dances - communal social dances from the 19th century. Also on Plough Sunday, we perform the ""WOOING"" MUMMERS PLAY from Bassingham. Here are some pictures of the VMM ""in action"" on Plough Sunday, January 2003 and Plough Sunday, January 2005.

361;;Vancouver Carnival Band;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=361;The Carnival Band is a community music project with ten years of history, based out of Commercial Drive’s Britannia Community Centre. Musical direction is provided by Ross Barrett and Tim Sars. Instrumentation for the band includes all range of brass, woodwinds, drums, percussion, accordions, and of course voice. Stage shows also allow us the opportunity to join our bass, guitar, fiddle, banjo, piano, and keyboard playing friends. Many of our favourite tunes are originals by band members. The remainder of our monstrous repertoire includes samba, calypso, swing, afrobeat, jazz, funk, disco, and traditional music from around the globe. We believe that community music is grounded in collaboration, with the aim of empowering the individuals involved. Songs and performances are a means to creative expression and community cohesiveness, rather than an end in themselves.;Canada;;;http://openairorchestra.nfshost.com/carnivalband/

Most recently, Electrabelle was brought on board with the band U2, creating video and lighting installations for the '360 degree' tour wrap party. Other projects include Grey Cup 2009 in Calgary featuring live shows with Maestro Fresh West, as well as Olympic-related events in Vancouver. Electrabelle has a strong interest in providing media tools and training to all those who seek it, not just those who can afford it. Her experience teaching at the Gulf Islands Film and Television school brought hundreds of under-priviledged youth and adults together to learn video and film techniques. For over seven years, this testing ground continually reinforced the empowerment that comes from learning to communicate through the voice of filmmaking. Now with W2, Electrabelle hopes to inspire and facilitate a new group of live media artists to tell their stories.";;;;http://www.electrabelle.com

The modernist sensibility of his photography advanced Vancouver's new rational and functionalist ideals of architecture and put Canadian architecture on an international footing. In 1998 the Vancouver Art Gallery had an exhibition entitled, ""The New Spirit: Modern Architecture in Vancouver, 1938-1963"".

They question existing social and cultural systems through the use of humour and irony. Her work often speaks to the ethos and aspirations of those on the periphery of mainstream society, drawing inspiration from counterculture movements that challenge the status quo. Zvonar treats imagery as metaphor, establishing a referential context that calls into question popular conceptions and historical canons to address cultural constructions of power. She often uses a feminist perspective to illustrate how rules of engagement were unbalanced in the past and remain so today. Zvonar has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions throughout Canada and in New York, Australia, Japan and Belgium.

He has worked in sculpture, video, photography and site-specific public installation. Many of his permanent sculptures and temporary installations in India and throughout Asia including exhibitions at Khoj, New Delhi (2008), Hong Kong Art fair (2010) have been constructed with bamboo. Considered a pedestrian material in India because of its abundance, Waqif draws on the multiple ways in which bamboo is used in India, including scaffolding for construction projects, etc.The use of bamboo underscores Waqif’s interest in innovative constructions using traditional, local materials (vernacular architecture) as well as his ongoing concern for environmental sustainability. However following invitations to create site-specific works in Europe, where bamboo is not a common material, Waqif turned his attention to the solid waste management systems in the cities he visited. This led to the use of more unconventional materials such as discarded wood panels, wiring, metal, steal and plastic waste. He has created site-specific installations for the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France (2012), the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial in Brisbane, Australia (2013), among others.;;;;

In these works, Wurm gives written or drawn instructions to participants that indicate actions or poses to perform with everyday objects such as chairs, buckets, fruit, or knit sweaters. These sculptures are by nature temporal and ephemeral, challenging the traditional and formal qualities of the medium. By incorporating actions into the process, and utilizing photography to capture and convey the experiences, the boundaries between art, daily life, spectator and participant break down.While Wurm considers humour an important tool in his work, there is always an underlying social critique of contemporary culture, particularly in response to the Capitalist influences and resulting societal pressures that the artist sees as contrary to our internal ideals.Erwin Wurm, born in Bruck an der Mur/Styria, Austria, lives and works in Vienna and Limberg, Austria. - Vancouver Art Gallery";Austria;;;

333;Pierre;Poussin;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=333;"Pierre’s work incorporates organic shapes, contrasting materials, and vibrant colors to convey his ideas. He thrives to create design solutions which conceptually and elegantly emphasize the surrounding area, along with the clients’ needs and interests. As an artist, he draws his inspiration from the neighbouring communities and their unique history and characteristics. He also finds inspiration in nature, where everything is at once minimal and deeply practical. Movement and animation are also evoked throughout his body of work, to engage, entice, and encourage public interaction. He hopes to express in form the dynamic balance needed in life, between fun and function, rest and action.  

Over the past few years, Pierre has been involved with many large scale design projects, with clients ranging from the city of Vancouver and the 2010 Olympics and Paralympics, the city of Toronto and Oakville, to the Peace Bridge Authority of Fort Erie, the Walt Disney Corporation, Princeton University, XM radio for Toyota/Lexus Canada, GreyEagle Casino, Toronto’s Royal Canadian Yacht Club, McMaster University, and Concord CityPlace’s ultra-chic, Panorama Lakeshore Condominium Tower.In addition to his design consultancy work, Pierre also has a successful furniture line, Mitosis, which was featured in the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and Toronto Life magazine, and has also been recently commissioned to become principal furniture for the lobby and lounge areas for Princeton University’s Julian Street Student Library.

As an extension of his art practice, Simon works with young people in the making of public art pieces as a way of pushing the awareness of how public space operates and how it is designed to do so. He co-authored with Susan Rome of  the Vancouver Art Gallery Public Programs Department a grade 11 and 12 curriculum on Public art for the Vancouver School Board.;Canada;;;

267;Joe;Fafard;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=267;"Nationally and internationally acclaimed artist, Joe Fafard, was born to French-Canadian parents in the small agricultural community of Ste. Marthe, Saskatchewan.  He attended the University of Manitoba (BFA 1966) and Pennsylvania State University (MFA 1968). He was at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina from 1968 – 1974 and visiting lecturer at the University of California at Davis in 1980-1981. Joe Fafard is a distinguished full-time artist and sculptor who currently resides on an acreage near Lumsden, Saskatchewan.    

Mr. Fafard is one of Canada’s leading professional visual artists and has exhibitions of a wide variety of work in galleries and museums across the country and around the world, including the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan.  He is widely recognized as being at the forefront of his art, and his outstanding contributions to the arts have significantly raised the profile of both Saskatchewan and Canada on the national stage. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981; awarded the Architectural Institute of Canada Allied Arts Award in 1987; received an honorary Degree from the University of Regina in 1989, and from the University of Manitoba in 2007; received the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002; received the National Prix Montfort in 2003; received the Lieutenant Governor’s Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts in 2005;  was named CTV Citizen of the Year in 2006; and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.  Joe Fafard will also be receiving his 3rd honorary Doctorat degree from the University of Saskatchewan in June of 2012.  

Perhaps the pinnacle of his career was the touring Retrospective exhibition, hosted by 6 different venues, from September 2007 through September 2009, jointly organized by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery in Regina.  However,  most recently, Joe Fafard was chosen to be honored by Canada Post in their “Art Canada” series of postage stamps, released February 23, 2012.  Three of his artworks are featured on the domestic Canadian stamps, the USA stamps and the International stamps.

In the early 1970’s, much of his sculpture used clay as a medium.  In 1985, he shifted to bronze as his chief sculptural medium, successfully establishing a foundry in Pense.  
His insight and humor characterize his portraits of neighbors, farm animals, wildlife, and famous artists that he came to respect as he learned his craft.  His work in bronze is displayed across Canada and his “cows” have become one of his trademarks.  Some say that Joe Fafard adds a sense of humor to his depiction of the everyday through his artwork; Joe says that he never really took it out...

341;Osvaldo;Yero;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=341;"Osvaldo Yero was born in Cuba in 1969 and immigrated to Canada in 1997. He currently lives and works in Vancouver, British Columbia. Working mainly in sculpture and installation, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing diaspora of Cuba.  Politically and socially charged, Yero’s work contends with issues of national identity and plays with the boundaries of kitsch and high art, frequently comprising small-scale ceramic objects that reference pop art and the tourist souvenir.  Metaphors of death and water are prevalent throughout Yero’s practice. Through large-scale installations, he has explored the effect of the multiple on the bodily experience of the viewer. Most recently he has investigated the effects of light on the eye through his sculptural light installation Passage, which will be presented at Access Gallery as part of the public art project Bright Light, commissioned by the City of Vancouver.

Solo exhibitions of Yero’s work include: Loop galeria 23 y 12, Havana, Cuba (2008); Hereafter, Xeno Gallery, Dadabase, Vancouver, BC (2003); Landmark, Belkin Satellite Vancouver, BC (2002); Transplant, Grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC (2002). Recent group exhibitions include: F.A.R.Xchange 1: The Desert Between Us, Future Arts Research, Arizona State University, Phoenix AZ (2008); Nuit Blanche Toronto ON (2006); Contemporary Art From Cuba: Irony and Survival on the Utopian Island, a traveling exhibition organized by Arizona State Art Museum, and circulated by Independent Curators International (ICI), New York (2001).";Canada;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=341&ImageId=1560;;

358;;Leaky Heaven Circus;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=358;Founded in 1999 by a few like-minded Vancouver theatre actors and writers, and based in East Vancouver, the award-winning company has always combined popular traditions -- such as commedia, clown, circus arts, melodrama and cabaret -- with so-called “high” forms to create unique vehicles to exploring cultural, social and regional issues. Whether inspired by Shakespeare and classic parables, the animal kingdom or life itself, the end results are original multi-disciplinary productions that challenge the mind, fuel the imagination and celebrate the human spirit. The company’s roots in the Canadian social movements and theatre experiments of the late 20th century are also evident in its work, as is the influence of 19th century philosophers, cultural theorists and the great physical theatre artists, such as Jacques LeCoq. Shows are designed to be challenging for adults, yet accessible to children.;Canada;;;http://www.leakyheaven.com
