            Given one target column description and many candidate column descriptions, predict all the pairs (candidate table name, candidate 
            description column name) that could be joined.

            Task: Look carefully at the target column description and candidate column descriptions and use this information to identify 
            patterns and relationships between the descriptions, the result must be a list of all the JOINable pairs found. If no joinable pair is 
            found the result should be just the word "none".

            Additional info: A JOIN in relational databases is an operation that retrieves related rows from two tables by linking them 
            based on related columns between them.
            
            Instructions: 
                1. Look at the target description given to you. 
                2. Look at the candidate descriptions in detail. 
                3. Predict if the target column description belongs to a column that may be used in join. 
                4. Select all the highly likely JOINs between these columns based only on these descriptions. Disregard the column names.

            Example 1:
                Target description: this column represents a worker's id
                Candidate tables: ['salary.csv','salary.csv','hospital.csv']
                Candidate description: ['the column worker_id represents the worker's id', 'this column represents a worker's salary', 'this column represents a hospital location']
                Possible JOINs: ('salary.csv', 'worker_id')
            
Target description:      The 'ORGANIZATION' column in this dataset captures a numeric code that describes the organizational structure or type of formation under which the entity operates. It appears to range from single-digit to multi-digit numbers, representing various categories of organizations. The values within this column are uniform across the dataset, often with repeated numeric entries such as '1', '2', '5', etc., indicating different classifications or types. For instance, a value of '1' could refer to one specific organization type across multiple records, while a '4' might indicate another separate type or classification. It's probable that these numeric codes are part of a predefined schema or list categorizing the nature of the organizations, such as trusts, corporations, or non-profit entities, though specific definitions of the numbers aren't provided directly within the sample data.

The addresses vary in format slightly, reflecting the diversity of the city\'s street naming conventions, but consistently provide crucial geographical context for users seeking to visit these centers either for recreational or community services.'
 'The "URLLINK" column contains web addresses or URLs that direct to specific pages related to various community centers and parks managed by the City of Vancouver. Each URL corresponds to a specific community center or recreational facility, providing users with an online link to access more detailed information about the facilities, services, or programs offered at these locations. These URLs are typically structured to include the official Vancouver city website, "vancouver.ca," followed by a more specific path that includes the name of the community center or facility. This suggests that each link serves as a direct portal to official city resources, allowing residents and visitors to obtain information, updates, or contact details pertinent to that specific site. The consistency in the domain name underscores their affiliation with the municipal government, ensuring the content is authoritative and relevant to the local community.'
 'The "Geom" column in the table contains geometric data represented in the GeoJSON format, specifically as "Point" features. Each entry in this column provides a set of coordinates—longitude and latitude—in an array format, indicating the geographic location of a specific site, typically a community center, within Vancouver. The coordinates are essential for mapping and spatial analysis, enabling the precise determination of each site\'s location on a map. This column helps in pinpointing the exact position of the facilities listed, aligning with their addresses provided in another column. The data is structured in a standardized way to ensure compatibility with geographic information systems (GIS) and other mapping tools, allowing for visualization and further spatial operations.'
 'The "Geo Local Area" column represents the neighborhood or district in which each entity, generally a community center or other public facility, is situated within a specific geographic context. This column provides a categorical depiction of the location, grouping facilities by the broader geographic region or locality in which they are based, often corresponding to known neighborhoods or administrative areas. The values are identifiers for regions within a city, such as Dunbar-Southlands, Hastings-Sunrise, Downtown, and others like Kitsilano or Strathcona. These identifiers align locations to well-recognized local communities, allowing users to associate facilities with their respective neighborhoods. This helps in understanding the regional distribution and accessibility of facilities, aiding in geographic analysis and resource allocation.'
 "The 'AT_STREET' column represents a numerical identifier associated with the intersection of streets or addresses referenced within urban geographic urban settings. Each value in this column is a floating point number which presumably links to a specific street location, possibly used for indexing or categorizing data related to city planning, navigation, or location-based services. This identifier helps in distinguishing between various street intersections or addresses, especially in densely populated areas where multiple intersections and addresses might exist in close proximity. The numbers appear to be arbitrary and most likely correspond to an internal referencing system within a larger dataset or city planning framework."
 'The "ON_STREET" column represents numerical identifiers associated with street locations. Each value in this column is a numeric code that identifies a specific street or road where a particular event, such as a traffic incident, is located or referenced. The numeric values appear to range from the 600s to the 800s, suggesting a systematic categorization or hierarchical designation within a known street numbering system of a city or geographical area. This column functions as part of a database or data system that includes information about street locations, and these numeric values likely correspond to actual street names or designations, which are not explicitly listed but might be used internally within the dataset to identify and relate different attributes of street infrastructure or transportation planning.'
 'The "XSTREET" column contains strings that represent intersections or junctions of streets or avenues. Each value within this column provides a specific location where two roads meet, typically formatted with the name of one street followed by the connecting street, usually using the "AND" separator. This information is crucial for identifying precise locations in a geographical context, facilitating navigation or mapping by highlighting notable intersections. The data in this column can be particularly useful for urban planning, traffic management, and in the context of emergency services or delivery logistics where understanding street connections is critical.'
 'The "Geom" column in the table contains geographical data represented in a structured format known as GeoJSON. Each entry within this column is a string that describes a geographical point, specified by its type and coordinates. The type is always indicated as "Point," suggesting that each entry represents a singular geographical location without any additional complexity, like lines or polygons. The critical information of each point is encapsulated within the "coordinates" array, which provides the precise geographical location using longitude and latitude values. Longitude is the first value in the coordinate array, followed by latitude, both of which are expressed as floating-point numbers. This spatial information allows for pinpointing exact positions on the Earth\'s surface, and is crucial for spatial analysis tasks such as mapping, navigation, or geographical data visualization within the context of each mentioned intersection.'
 'The target column "Geo Local Area" in the given table represents the geographical locality or neighborhood of each specified location within a city. Each value in this column identifies the specific area or district where the intersections or street coordinates mentioned in the column "XSTREET" are situated. For instance, intersections like \'W 55TH AV AND MACDONALD ST\' or \'W 49TH AV AND BALACLAVA ST\' are associated with the \'Kerrisdale\' locality. The values in this column primarily serve to contextualize each geographical point, as represented by their respective coordinate data in the "Geom" column, within commonly recognized local areas, such as \'Kerrisdale\', \'Downtown\', \'Killarney\', among others. This categorization allows for a clearer understanding of where each intersection is placed within the broader urban layout, facilitating analysis related to that region\'s features, demographics, traffic patterns, or developments.'
 'The target column "FREQUENCY" in the table provides information on the periodicity of the data collected. Each entry in this column specifies the time interval over which the data point was recorded or aggregated. In the given table values, every entry in the "FREQUENCY" column is labeled as "Annual," signifying that the data has been compiled on a yearly basis. This annual frequency indicates that the entries pertain to a full year\'s worth of data collection or calculation, reflecting summaries or totals over the duration of a calendar year. This information helps in understanding the temporal nature of the dataset and allows for appropriate temporal analysis, comparisons, or trend observations over successive years if data from other years were included.'
 'The target column "DATE" contains values that represent the year during which the data was recorded or reported. In the context of this table, the "DATE" column specifically holds the year "2011" for all entries, indicating that the data set is centered around information collected or compiled in that particular year. This column does not denote a specific day or month, but rather signifies the annual reporting period, which is further emphasized by the "FREQUENCY" column that contains the value "Annual." The uniformity of the value "2011" across all entries suggests that the entire dataset is bounded by this temporal constraint, providing a snapshot of the demographic or statistical data as it existed in Botswana and its regions throughout the year 2011. The singularity of the year value implies that any temporal analysis or comparison is specific to 2011 and does not provide insights into changes over time or trends beyond this single year.'
 'The "REGION_ID" column contains identifiers that uniquely represent different geographic regions within the country of Botswana. These identifiers are alphanumeric codes, which often consist of prefixes that likely denote larger administrative areas (e.g., "BW" for Botswana) followed by additional letters that specify sub-regions or cities. For example, "BW" might indicate the entire country, while adding "-SE" denotes the South East region, or "-CE-OR" corresponds to a more specific locality like Orapa within the Central district. These codes serve as concise labels to identify each region for organizational or analytical purposes within the dataset.'
 'The "REGION_NAME" column in the table represents the specific names of geographic or administrative regions within the country of Botswana. Each entry in this column corresponds to a unique region that may vary in scale from large districts to smaller settlements or areas. The names such as "Botswana", "Gaborone", "Francistown", and others mentioned in this column are identifiers that provide context about the area to which the data in the corresponding row applies. These region names are used alongside other columns such as "REGION_ID" and "REGION_REGIONID", which appear to be coding systems, potentially to standardize or categorize the regions for data processing or reference purposes. The column serves to humanize and make more legible the geographic area the data point is associated with, serving as a key reference in the interpretation and analysis of demographic or other statistical data present in the table.'
 'The "REGION_REGIONID" column in the table provides a unique identifier for each geographical region mentioned in the dataset. The values in this column are composed of alphanumeric codes that correspond to specific regions within Botswana. Each entry in this column matches an entry in the "REGION_ID" and is consistent with the "REGION_NAME" column, suggesting a direct mapping of region names to their respective identifier codes. These codes appear to be structured combinations of abbreviations that reflect specific areas, such as districts, towns, or other administrative divisions. This column is crucial for demarcating and consistently referencing regions in the dataset, facilitating the organization, classification, and retrieval of data related to demographic or statistical information associated with each region.'
 'The "SEX_ID" column in the dataset serves as an identifier for the sex classification of the population data presented in each row. This column contains alphanumeric codes that correspond to specific categories of sex within the dataset. For example, the values "KN.S1," "KN.S2," and "KN.S3" are used to categorize the data based on sex, where typically, such codes could denote categories such as "Both Sexes," "Male," and "Female," although this particular mapping would need to be verified against a codebook or data dictionary. These codes help to stratify the population or demographic data, allowing for the segmentation of data points by gender for analysis. The purpose of having such a column is to facilitate analysis and reporting that can be focused on gender-specific trends or patterns within the data provided for each region and year.'
 'The "SEX_NAME" column in the table delineates the gender classification of the population data captured in each row. This column contains nominal categorical values, specifically labeling data entries with either "Both Sexes," "Male," or "Female." Each entry in this column corresponds directly to the "SEX_ID" column, which seems to serve as an encoded identifier for the sex name. "Both Sexes" denotes data aggregated for the entire population without sex differentiation, "Male" implies that the data is specific to males, and "Female" indicates that the data pertains to the female population. The context of this column is essential as it aids in differentiating population statistics based on gender across various regions and years as designated in the dataset.'
 'The "VALUE" column in this table represents a numerical figure that provides specific data about each corresponding entry in the dataset. The numbers in this column are associated with demographic information concerning the population count of different regions and sub-regions within Botswana for the year 2011. These values are categorized by frequency, regions, and sex, indicating either the entire population, male population, or female population, collectively referred to as \'Both Sexes\', \'Male\', or \'Female\'. For instance, a value of 2024904.0 for \'Botswana\' under \'Both Sexes\' indicates the total population across all sexes for that year, while a value of 1035947.0 indicated for \'Female\' represents the female population count in the same region. Thus, this column quantifies the population associated with each specification of gender and geographical division, and the numeric data it contains is crucial for demographic analysis and planning.']
