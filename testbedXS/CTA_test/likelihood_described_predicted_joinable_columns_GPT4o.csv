This column provides categorical data, indicating the specific area or district within the city that corresponds to each entry in the table. It helps in categorizing and identifying locations based on the broader community areas they belong to, such as 'Arbutus-Ridge', 'Mount Pleasant', 'Hastings-Sunrise', etc. These names correspond to recognized local areas or neighborhoods within Vancouver, known for their distinct characteristics and residential or communal settings. Essentially, this column serves as a geographic designation to group locations within the broader context of Vancouver's established local area divisions.","The ""Geo Local Area"" column in the table describes a specific geographic area or neighborhood within the city where each library branch is located. Each entry in this column provides a name that typically corresponds to a designated urban area or local community within a city. These names are well-known and commonly used to delineate different parts of a city, making it easier for residents and visitors to understand the general location of each library branch.

The values in this column include names such as ""Killarney,"" ""Fairview,"" ""Kitsilano,"" ""Mount Pleasant,"" and others. These names represent the areas or communities where the respective library branches are situated. For example, the branch in the ""Champlain Heights"" listed in the table is located within the ""Killarney"" Geo Local Area, while the ""Firehall"" branch is located in the ""Fairview"" Geo Local Area.

The ""Geo Local Area"" helps to geographically categorize the branches and provides a quick reference for identifying which part of the city a particular library branch serves.

community-gardens-and-food-trees.csv,Geom,libraries.csv,Geom,community-gardens-and-food-trees.csv#Geom,libraries.csv#Geom,"The ""Geom"" column contains geometric data that represents the geographical location of community gardens and related sites in Vancouver, BC. Each entry is formatted as a JSON object, which includes a type and coordinates. Specifically, the type is fixed as ""Point"", indicating a singular geographical point, and the coordinates are a pair of longitude and latitude values in the decimal format. 

The coordinates specify exact positions on the Earth's surface, providing precise spatial locations for each garden or site. This data can be utilized for mapping, spatial analysis, or integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to visualize and analyze the distribution of community gardens across different local areas in Vancouver. For example, an entry from the ""Geom"" column might look like: '{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.1549951, 49.2507172]}' where -123.1549951 is the longitude and 49.2507172 is the latitude.","The ""Geom"" column in this table provides the geographical coordinates for each location listed in the table.

The coordinates consist of two numerical values: the first value represents the longitude, and the second value represents the latitude of a location. This allows for spatial representation and mapping of the locations on a geographical map with precision. For example, the Geom entry '{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.0402, 49.2191]}' corresponds to a geographic point with a longitude of -123.0402 and a latitude of 49.2191.

cultural-spaces.csv,PRIMARY_USE,eo_xx.csv,SORT_NAME,cultural-spaces.csv#PRIMARY_USE,eo_xx.csv#SORT_NAME,"The ""PRIMARY_USE"" column represents the main purpose or function of the cultural spaces listed in the table. Each entry in this column describes the predominant activity, service, or classification associated with a particular cultural space. The values in this column help identify what the cultural space primarily offers or engages in, which can range from being a museum or gallery, an artist studio, a community center, a performance space, to educational institutions and others. This helps in categorizing each entry based on its primary role or use within the community. Here are some observations on the distinct values present within this column:

1. **Museum/Gallery**: Indicates that the cultural spaces serve as venues for the display and exhibition of art, historical artifacts, or exhibitions of cultural significance.

2. **Artist Studio**: Implies that the space is primarily used by artists for creating and possibly showcasing their works.

3. **Performance Space**: Denotes spaces primarily used for performing arts, including theatre, music, dance, and other performances.

4. **Community Centre/Hall**: Indicates facilities which are used for community gatherings, group activities, social support, and events.

5. **Educational Institution**: Denotes spaces dedicated to educational activities or instruction, potentially offering classes, workshops, or training.

6. **Library/Archives**: Implies the space is used for holding collections of books, documents, or other types of archival materials.

7. **Artist Studio with Residence**: Represents spaces that function not only as studio workspaces for artists but also as living quarters.

These categories help to succinctly communicate the primary role and function of each cultural space, which can aid in assessing their contribution to the community, their public engagement, and their core activities.","The ""SORT_NAME"" column appears to hold a value associated with each entity or organization listed in the table. This column is often used for organization or sorting purposes, which is evident as it is labeled as ""SORT_NAME"". Here are some observations about the column:

1. **Data Type and Content**: The ""SORT_NAME"" column contains mostly `NaN` values, which indicates that it might not be filled for many organizations. For the non-null entries, the content seems to consist of names of individuals or entities, likely associated with the respective organization in some way.

2. **Usage**: Given the nature of the column name (""SORT_NAME""), it suggests these values might be used as a key or reference point for sorting or organizing the data about these entities. The non-null examples provided specify names or titles that could potentially be used to sort the records alphabetically or to facilitate groupings.

3. **Variability**: The presence of `NaN` values indicates that the ""SORT_NAME"" is not universally applicable or required for all records within the dataset. This variability may depend on the availability of such a sorting reference or the relevance of such data for certain records.

4. **Contextual Meaning**: In some records, the ""SORT_NAME"" corresponds to individual representatives or associated titles (like ""NATCA LOCAL STT"" for an association) which might represent an alternative or formal representation of the organization or its organizer.

This might be particularly used for organizations that do not fit neatly into a standard postal system, such as those located outside the US or operating internationally.

3. **Geographical Indicator**: The ZIP code typically acts as a geographical identifier, pinpointing a more precise location of the organization's address. However, in this dataset, it might not be entirely reliable given the prevalence of placeholder values ('00000-0000').

4. **Potential International Scope**: The presence of non-standard postal codes and placeholder values also suggests that the organizations could be based internationally, and the ZIP column may not always represent a traditional US postal code.

5. **Consistency Across Entries**: Considering the placeholder ZIPs, this column might not consistently provide valuable geographical information for each row but generally seeks to fill the requirement of a postal address field in the dataset structure.

Overall, while the ""ZIP"" column intends to provide postal code data for each entity, its effectiveness is limited by prevalent placeholder codes, especially for international or non-traditional addresses.",10

1. **Type of Information**: This column occasionally includes the name of a point of contact, often prefixed with symbols such as ""%."" This suggests that the contact information is typically intended for mail or similar communications.

2. **Purpose**: The ""ICO"" column acts as a secondary identifier or clarification which supplements the main organizational name found in the ""NAME"" column.

3. **Data Variability and Format**: 
   - Some entries have specific names, such as '% RODOLFO O FONT' or '% TATSUHIKO WAKAO,' providing a personal contact associated with the entity.
   - There are also instances where the ""ICO"" field is left as `nan`, indicating that not all records have this additional identification detail, which suggests that this information might not be mandatory or consistently available for all organizations.

4. **Usage Scenario**: This column likely serves stakeholders who require precise recognition of entities, such as for mailing, legal, or official documentation purposes where knowing the specific individual or subgroup associated with a larger entity is beneficial.

For the non-null entries, the content seems to consist of names of individuals or entities, likely associated with the respective organization in some way.

2. **Usage**: Given the nature of the column name (""SORT_NAME""), it suggests these values might be used as a key or reference point for sorting or organizing the data about these entities.
